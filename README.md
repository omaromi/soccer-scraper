This is the first ever program I made.

I am learning Python and wanted to practice through data science. I was getting bored of most of the datasets out there on Kaggle. None of them seemed to keep my attention for long. So I decided the best way to get myself interested in a dataset would be to create it!

I built this using BeautifulSoup.

I webscraped understat.com for all player statistics for each game of my favorite team, Arsenal.





One thing I'd love to note is that as a beginner, I love Jupyter. I so much prefer working in the Jupyter notebook because I feel like I can compartmentalize my work into the cells. When one chunk is working, then I feel confident to move on to the next.
